Also, please do not consider original quick merge sort (OGQMS) for part 2 (or part 1 for that matter(not that you would)), it's simply the original version I created where merge writes over the original array, however, I'm submitting an updated version as it adheres strictly to the requirements of the assignment (merge returns a combined region that is then used to write over the original array). I just figured this would be a good place to save everything related to assignment one, including prototypes.
